Once you have conducted your systematic review, and potentially also conducted a meta-analysis, it is time to tell the community what you found and ensure the findings from your review reach your audience. 

Be careful when interpreting the results; acknowledge sources of bias; consider heterogeneity, generalisability, and relevance. 

It may help to use a [GRADE Approach](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187271){target="_blank"} to rate the certainty of the evidence of preclinical animal studies, in the context of therapeutic interventions. 

Report your systematic review in a way that allows reproducibility of the results and future updating. 

## Good reporting


We recommend following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses  (PRISMA) Guidelines.  The checklist can be found [here.](http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/Checklist){target="_blank"} In addition, we recommend using the PRISMA Flowchart to visualise the studies in your systematic review process. The PRISMA Flowchart template can be [found here.](http://prisma-statement.org/prismastatement/flowdiagram){target="_blank"}
