# Tools for Systematic Review

We highly recommend using software and tools to help you along the way. We have mentioned many tools throughout this Wiki, here is a list of all of them: 


[SyRF](https://syrf.org.uk/){target="_blank"}, the Systematic Review Facility, is a free-to-use online platform to support your preclinical systematic review. Its features and auxiliary tools include: 

- Deduplication of systematic searches [ASysD App](https://camarades.shinyapps.io/RDedup/){target="_blank"}
- Screening (title & abstract as well as full text)
- Data Annotation & Extraction tailored for animal experiments
- Meta-Analysis of data from SyRF [click here](https://camarades.shinyapps.io/meta-analysis-app/){target="_blank"}


**Additional tools include:** 

- Citation screening: [Rayyan](https://rayyan.qcri.org/welcome){target="_blank"} and [SysRev](https://sysrev.com/){target="_blank"}.
- Data extraction from graphs: [Adobe desktop ruler](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/grids-guides-measurements-pdfs.html){target="_blank"} or [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/){target="_blank"} 
- Search translation across databases: [Polyglot Search Translator](https://sr-accelerator.com/#/polyglot){target="_blank"}

__Machine Learning:__ 
If you are doing a very large systematic review, consider training a custom machine learning algorithm. [Contact us](mailto:camarades.berlin@charite.de) for more information.
