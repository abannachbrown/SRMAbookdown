# Systematic Reviews & 3Rs {#srs-3rs}

The principles of the 3Rs are a framework for humane animal research. Systematic review is a valuable tool for advancing the 3Rs, primarily through reduction and refinement of animal use in research. Using existing animal data, systematic review can contribute to improvements in animal studies including:

-   Providing reliable data to support sample size calculations for various experimental outcomes
-   Allowing comparison of the statistical performance of different experimental outcome measures
-   Characterising the extent to which subjecting animals to multiple tests contributes to additional knowledge
-   Assessing whether the same information can be provided by less invasive tests
