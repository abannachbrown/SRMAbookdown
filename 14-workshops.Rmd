We have created a web-based tutorial to complement the workshop: <a href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/mission-approaches/education-and-training/how-to-conduct-a-preclinical-animal-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

The web-based app uses R programming language to work through a meta-analysis of animal data but you do not need any previous experience with R to complete the tutorial.

The tutorial use examples data from the publication:
