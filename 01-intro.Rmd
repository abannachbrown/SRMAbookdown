# Preclinical Systematic Reviews {#intro}
<br>

## What is a systematic review? 

A systematic review (SR) is a literature review that involves systematically locating, appraising, and synthesising evidence from scientific studies to answer a defined research question based on pre-specified criteria.

The methods of a systematic review (and meta-analysis) should be transparent and reproducible. This means that the methods are planned, conducted, and reported in a way that can be repeated by other research groups.

## What is a meta-analysis?

A meta-analysis is a method of combining quantitative results from individual studies identified through systematic review in an overall statistical analysis.

## Clinical & preclinical reviews

There are many differences between preclinical and clinical systematic reviews, which is why we developed this Wiki, specific to preclinical systematic review methodology.

## Why perform preclinical SRs? 

There are many reasons to perform preclinical systematic reviews:

- To summarise evidence from multiple similar studies to allow for more accurate estimates of effect
- The methods used to find and select studies are transparent and reproducible, reducing bias and increasing the likeliness of producing reliable and accurate conclusions. 
- Summarise findings from all available studies making information easier for the end-user to read and understand
- Analyse individual study quality to inform confidence in the results
- Quantitative synthesis of results (meta-analysis)
- Allow for evidence-based inferences

The results of preclinical systematic reviews can:

-   Provide evidence to change research practice by identifying risks of bias in preclinical experiments
-   Influence development of reporting guidelines and editorial policies
-   Provide evidence to support reporting of positive, negative and neutral results through detection of publication bias
-   Identify study design features that compromise potential clinical application
-   Contribute to evidence-based clinical trial design
